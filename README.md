GtkSourceView syntax highlighting for the [Elixir programming language](http://elixir-lang.org/)

Covers Elixir version 1.1.X

## Usage: 

Copy `elixir.lang` into one of these directories: 

 * `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-X.X/language-specs/`
 * `/usr/local/share/gtksourceview-X.X/language-specs/`
 * `/usr/share/gtksourceview-X.X/language-specs/`

Replace 'X.X' with your version of GtkSourceView.

_gedit_ and other tools using GtkSourceView should then show Elixir syntax highlighting.

Version for older Elixir releases can be found in `old_versions`

Have also a look at [elixir-ctags](https://github.com/mmorearty/elixir-ctags) to further enhance your gedit experience when writing Elixir code.
